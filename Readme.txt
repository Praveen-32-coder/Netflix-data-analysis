1.Overview
	This project leverages the Netflix dataset to uncover trends and insights related to the content offered on the platform. The analysis includes key visualizations using plotly.express, which makes it easy to explore data interactively. By applying text analysis with the textblob library, insights are also gained on the sentiment of the content and other textual attributes.

2.Technologies Used
Python 3.12.4
Numpy: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
Pandas: For data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.
Plotly Express: For creating interactive data visualizations.
TextBlob: For text processing and sentiment analysis.

3.Analysis Tasks

Top 5 Directors
	
	The top 5 directors are identified based on the number of movies or TV shows directed. This allows users to understand which directors have the most content available on Netflix.

Top 5 Actors
	Similarly, the top 5 actors are identified by analyzing the most frequently appearing actors across all movies and TV shows in the dataset.

4.Distribution of Content Ratings
	A visualization is created to show the distribution of content ratings (e.g., TV-MA, PG, etc.) across Netflix's library. This provides insights into the type of content available for different age groups.

5.Trend of Content Produced Every Year
	A line plot is created to display the trend of Netflix content production over the years. This gives a clear visual representation of how the number of titles produced has increased or decreased over time.
